This lab walks you through using the Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and Auto Scaling services to load balance and automatically scale your infrastructure.


Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances. It enables you to achieve fault tolerance in your applications by seamlessly providing the required amount of load balancing capacity needed to route application traffic.

Auto Scaling helps you maintain application availability and allows you to scale your Amazon EC2 capacity out or in automatically according to conditions you define.
