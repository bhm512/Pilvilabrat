# IAM and Security: Lab 1 - Introduction to AWS IAM ja IAM and Security: Configure Azure Role-Based Access Control

## What was specifically done in the lab?

### AWS IAM

In this exercise:
- I logged into AWS Management Console and there worked with IAM Dashboard and Indentity components
- I created a new IAM User with programmatic and console acces
- Worked with IAM group that I created, and attached IAM Polices that needed.
- Put an IAM User to IAM Group
- Created and tested an IAM role
- Worked with security practices like: MFA, least priviledge and password polices

### Azure RBAC 

In this excercise: 
- I logged into Azure Portal
- Did some research with Azure IAM (Access Control)
- Trained with Azure AD idnetity
- Assigned a few built-in Azure roles to the user
- Changed permissions to a resource group
- Tested that assigned RBAC permissions allowed or restricted on certain actions

## Identify what cloud services you used during the lab?

### AWS

In AWS I used IAM (Identity and Access Management) and AWS Management Console

### Azure

With Azure I used Azure RBAC, Entra ID and Azure Portal 

## What technical details did you learn from the lab about each cloud services used?

### AWS

With AWS my "key" learnings would be how IAM users are humans or system identities. I also think
that knowin IAM groups are important (you can assign permissions to a multiple users at once).

Authentication vs authorization:

IAM User/Role = who you are

IAM Policy = what you can do

I it is also important to use a principle of least privilege!
